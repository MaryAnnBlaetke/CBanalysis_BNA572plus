# Constraint-Based Analysis of a metabolic model for *Brassica napus* seed development (BNA572plus)

The metabolic model of *Brassica napus* seed development (BNA572plus) was published by:

Hay JO, Shi H, Heinzel N, Hebbelmann I, Rolletschek H and Schwender J (2014) Integration of a constraint-based metabolic model of Brassica napus developing seeds with 13C-metabolic flux analysis. Front. Plant Sci. 5:724. doi: [10.3389/fpls.2014.00724](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fpls.2014.00724/full)

This repository focuses on the re-implementation of the constraint-based analysis using python and cobrapy.
